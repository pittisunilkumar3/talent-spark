## Notes

1. **Branch Association**: Departments are associated with a specific branch by setting the `branch_id` field.
2. **Unique Constraint**: Department names must be unique within a branch. The same department name can exist in different branches.
3. **Short Code**: The `short_code` field is optional but can be used for quick reference.
4. **Deletion**: When a branch is deleted, all associated departments are also deleted (CASCADE).
5. **Pagination**: The API supports pagination with `page` and `limit` query parameters.
6. **Filtering**: You can filter departments by `is_active` and `branch_id`.
7. **Search**: You can search for departments by name or short_code using the `search` query parameter.
